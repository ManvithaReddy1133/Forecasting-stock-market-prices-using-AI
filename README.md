This project, "Forecasting Stock Prices with Machine Learning and Real-Time Data using LSTM and LangChain," focuses on developing an intelligent system that blends machine learning, real-time data analysis, and AI-driven insights to predict stock prices and analyze financial trends. The core of the project employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network well-suited for handling time-series data. LSTM is used to forecast stock prices based on historical trends and patterns. This ensures accurate predictions by capturing both short-term fluctuations and long-term dependencies in stock data. To provide a comprehensive analysis, the project integrates Yahoo Finance for acquiring historical stock data, including price history, volume, and financial statements. The inclusion of financial data enhances the systemâ€™s capability to assess a company's past performance and current valuation, which are critical for informed forecasting. The real-time aspect of the project is realized through web scraping for recent market news using Google queries. These news updates provide a sentiment-based understanding of how current events and announcements might influence stock prices, making the system dynamic and adaptable to live market conditions. The project also leverages LangChain and OpenAI GPT models to process the gathered data and generate insightful narratives. LangChain integrates tools and workflows that enable seamless querying of data, automated reasoning, and content generation. For instance, the system might summarize a company's financial health, explain stock predictions, or respond to user-specific queries with natural language explanations.
